My idea for Project 1 is to put together a Portfolio site which I will use when looking for work as a web developer when I have completed my Diploma.

I really didn't know where to begin in terms of design or structure in general so I looked at sites such as thre below for inspiration as to what an award winnihng porfolio site looks like:
http://www.rleonardi.com/design-portfolio/
http://y78.fr/3/



I have decided my site will have a simple Top navigation menu containing, Home, Photography, Sites, Contact

The design will be responsive to the device used to access it, to avoid issues when using mobile devices etc, and will factor in accessability for those who are visually impaired for example.

I wnated to bring the concept of accesability into the design also, creating a simple monochromatic affect with a simple flow to ensure if screen readers are being used it is not overly complex to navigate.

I downloaded the  screen reader plugin which really allowed me the opportunity to experience the web page as a visually impaired user.

My target audience is a recuiter or potential employer, and the  goal is to sell myself and my experience(some content examples are not my own) to sell myself in the best possible light.

The brief for this project was to create a static web page to  include 3 pages.

In this project, you’ll build a static front-end site to present useful information to
users, using all the technologies that you have learned about so far.

Data is presented in a way that helps users achieve their goals, e.g. learning about
a product/service that they are interested in. The presentation of this data
advances the site owner's goals, e.g. helps them market a product/service.


Include educational history and work experience.
● Outline skills and any other relevant competencies and interests.
● Provide basic personal information and contact information for
recruiters.

Advanced potential feature (nice-to-have)
● Showcase portfolio of projects so far (in-lieu of links to real projects
that you'd build later, feel free to include links to fake projects or
random sites on the internet at this stage)

Scope plane- what features based on information from the strategy plane, do you want to include in your design. What's on the table for production release and what's not at least for now

structure plane- how is the information structured and how is it logically grouped?

Skeleton Plane - how will the information be represented & how will users navigate through the page / features 

Surface Plane - what will the finihsed prouct look like colors / typography and design elements  etc will we use
