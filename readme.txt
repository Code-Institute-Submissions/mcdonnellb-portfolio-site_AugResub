My idea for Project 1 is to put together a Portfolio site which I will use when looking for work as a web developer when I have completed my Diploma.

I really didn't know where to begin in terms of design or structure in general so I looked at sites such as thre below for inspiration as to what an award winnihng porfolio site looks like:

http://y78.fr/3/



I have decided my site will have a simple right hand navigation menu containing, Home, Photography, Sites, Contact

The design will be responsive to the device used to access it, to avoid issues when using mobile devices etc, and will factor in accessability for those who are visually impaired for example.

My target audience is a recuiter and goal is to sell myself and my experience(some content examples are not my own) to sell myself in the best possible light.

The brief for this progect was to create a static web page to  include 3 pages, 

In this project, you’ll build a static front-end site to present useful information to
users, using all the technologies that you have learned about so far.

Data is presented in a way that helps users achieve their goals, e.g. learning about
a product/service that they are interested in. The presentation of this data
advances the site owner's goals, e.g. helps them market a product/service.


Include educational history and work experience.
● Outline skills and any other relevant competencies and interests.
● Provide basic personal information and contact information for
recruiters.

Advanced potential feature (nice-to-have)
● Showcase portfolio of projects so far (in-lieu of links to real projects
that you'd build later, feel free to include links to fake projects or
random sites on the internet at this stage)
